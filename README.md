# Canvas Duktape

This is kind of a contiunation of Toy Browser except designed to run Javascript games that use the Canvas API.

The goal is ultimately to run simple Javascript games on embedded platforms like the GCW Zero, Bittboy, RS-97...
at much greater speeds than a web browser would on them and with a low lower RAM footprint.
